          <h2>The Nightingale of Bollywood</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Voice of the Millennium</b>  28 September 1929 – 6 February 2022)
            Lata Mangeshkar was born in Indore on September 28, 1929, and became, 
            quite simply, the most popular playback singer in Bollywood's history.
            She sung for over 50 years for actresses from Nargis to Preity Zinta, 
            as well as recorded albums of all kinds (ghazals, pop, etc). Until the
            1991 edition, when her entry disappeared, the Guinness Book of World Records
            listed her as the most-recorded artist in the world with not less than 30,000 
            solo, duet,and chorus-backed songs recorded in 20 Indian languages between 948 
            and 1987. Today that number may have reached 40,000!
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>Her singing style was initially reminiscent of Noor Jehan, 
            but she soon overcame that and evolved her own distinctive style. 
            Her sister, Asha Bhosle, too, came up in the late 1950s and the two 
            of them were the queens of Indian playback singing right through to the 1990s.
             Her voice had a special versatile quality, which meant that finally music 
             composers could stretch their creative experiments to the fullest. Although 
             all her songs were immediate hits under any composer, it was the composers C. 
             Ramchandra and Madan Mohan who made her sound her sweetest and challenged her
              voice like no other music director.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Mangeshkar won several awards and honours, including the Bharat Ratna (2001),

                    three National Film Awards and 15 Bengal Film Journalists'
                Association Awards. She also won four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards.

                the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993 and Filmfare Special Awards

                 ("[she] is never off-key").[191] Actor Dilip Kumar once commented, 
                 "Lata Mangeshkar ki awaaz kudrat ki takhleek ka ek karishma hain",
                  meaning "Lata Mangeshkar's voice is a miracle from God".[192]
                
                Lata Mangeshkar was included in the 'In Memoriam' segment at the 2022 
                British Academy Film and Television Awards (BAFTA).[193]
